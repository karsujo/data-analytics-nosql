If the list of words for positive and negative classification needs to be read from another document, you can use the $lookup stage in the MongoDB aggregation pipeline to fetch the list from another collection. Here's an example:

Assume you have a collection named wordList with documents like this:

json
Copy code
[
  { "type": "positive", "words": ["good", "great", "nice", "pleasant"] },
  { "type": "negative", "words": ["bad", "terrible"] }
]
Now, you can use the following MongoDB aggregation query:

javascript
Copy code
db.yourCollectionName.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "wordList",
      localField: "someFieldInYourCollection", // Adjust this field based on your schema
      foreignField: "type",
      as: "wordList"
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$wordList"
  },
  {
    $project: {
      CustomerReview: 1,
      review_classification: {
        $cond: {
          if: {
            $regexMatch: {
              input: "$CustomerReview",
              regex: `(${'$wordList.words'.join('|')})`,
              options: "i"
            }
          },
          then: "$wordList.type",
          else: "Neutral"
        }
      }
    }
  }
])
This example uses $lookup to join your collection with the wordList collection based on a common field (someFieldInYourCollection). The $unwind stage is used to flatten the array created by the $lookup stage, and then the $project stage applies the classification based on the regular expression match.

Remember to adjust the localField in the $lookup stage based on your actual schema. Also, make sure to replace yourCollectionName with your collection's actual name.
